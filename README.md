# Constant current LED Driver
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jakeler/LED-CC-Firmware.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jakeler/LED-CC-Firmware)
Microcontroller based constant current driver. Based around a LM2596S drop down regulator (because these complete modules are cheaper than buying the components) and an Arduino Pro Mini.

The repo contains a PlatformIO project to compile the Arduino firmware. In the schematic/ subdirectory is the KiCAD project with the PCB layout, footprints, etc.
